<!-- role changing controller should be added -->
<!-- if user is admin it cant be delited check the role first before deleting -->
<!-- they can upload there promotion video or photo but confirmation should be done by admin -->

advert period should be known and decided

email should be changed to sintae's email
add an email filter for not registering company email
make logo image file a link and integrate in every email 
if admin update status is denied only delete the advert with denied status not the backup one
if paying request is taking more than 30 days delete the uploaded document and send to the uploader that it has been deleted and they can reupload again.
dont accept company email
